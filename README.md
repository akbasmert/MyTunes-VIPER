## Description

-> TThe application consists of two screens. On the first screen, you will find recommended songs for you. When you click on the search section, you can search for the desired song, video, movie, etc. As a result of the search, filtering options will appear. You can apply filters to show only music, podcasts, etc. When you click on a song, you will be taken to the detail page where the song will start playing automatically. You can add the songs you like to your favorites.

-> The application is designed as modular and VIPER Architecture is used.

-> Search results are displayed using the API provided by "itunes.apple.com".

-> The songs you added to your favorites on the Detail Page have been recorded using coredata.

-> Unit Tests and UI Tests were written to test whether the application works properly.
